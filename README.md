# CS305_SNHU_SoftwareSecurity

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to incorporate additional security into their already existing application.
- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  - I enjoyed the static testing portion of this project. It allows us to see how important security is and finding the false positives in our reports to ensure that it was not really a security issue. 
- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful? 
  - The dependency check tool was most helpful. This tool allowed us to check vulnerabilites automatedly instead of one by one. 
- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  - Most of the vulverabilites found were due to using older libraries. In the future I would like ot use penetration testing for this.
- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - FOr this class I lived in the debugger. After refactoring I ran another vulernability test to make sure no new vulnerabilites were introduced into the code. 
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - My go to place for help when I am stuck is Stackoverflow. I found myself here often throught the course. 
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  - THe use of my hash function to incorporate SHA-256 in my code.
